# MEASURE OF VARIATIONS 

## Statistical Calculations
> The application performs various statistical calculations on the filtered dataset. These include:

## Standard Deviation: Measures the amount of variation or dispersion of ages.
> Variance: Indicates how much the ages differ from the average age.
> Quartile Deviation: Provides a measure of the spread of the middle 50% of ages.
> Skewness: Assesses the asymmetry of the age distribution.
> Maximum Age: The highest age value in the dataset.
> Minimum Age: The lowest age value in the dataset.
> Probability Distributions
> The application calculates and visualizes the probability distributions of ages:

## Probability Density Function (PDF): Displays the likelihood of different age values occurring.
> Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): Represents the cumulative probability of age values, showing the probability that a variable will take a value less than or equal to a particular age.
> Outlier Detection
> The application identifies outliers in the age data:
> Z-scores: Standardizes age values to measure the number of standard deviations an element is from the mean.
> Identifying Outliers: Detects ages with z-scores less than -3 or greater than 3, highlighting significant deviations from the average age.
